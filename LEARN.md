## About
The **SUMMER SUNSET** project is an idea that came to me, and I believe it has potential. I usually rely on tutorials for my projects, but for this one, I decided to go off on my own and see what I could come up with. I'm pretty happy with the outcome, but I am open to feedback and suggestions. Overall, I think it's a good project and I hope you will too!
> this project use open-source project like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Tabler](https://tabler.io/), [Tabler Icon](https://tabler-icons.io/)
